    "As you will see there are two types of cells in this Jupyter Notebook, **Python** cells indicated with `In [ ]:` and **Markdown** cells that have no marking to the left of the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **Python** works in the usual way. Enter your code and press `Shift Enter` to run the cell. The output will be displayed below the cell. Variables and functions will be accessible by the other cells after you have run the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **Markdown** cells use the Markdown type setting language. This is a very simple type setting system. Check the [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for a overview of the commends. Furthermore, **Markdown** works with **LaTeX** math, `$ $` for inline equations and `$$ $$` for centered equations. press `Shift Enter` to compile the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have answered the questions and are finished with the assignment you can export the **Jupyter Notebook** as a PDF. Go to the top left, click on `File` then `Download As` and Choose **PDF**. If this feature is not supported by your system, you can also choose **LaTeX**. Then you Download a **LaTeX** project. You can then use your preferred **LaTeX** compiler to create the **PDF**. After generation you PDF report, please double check if all answers/plots are correctly displayed.\n",
